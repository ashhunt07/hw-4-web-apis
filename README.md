A timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores

Javascript Quiz

Test you JavaScript knowledge with this fun, timed quiz! You will be asked a series of questions that will text your basic knowledge of Javascript in a fun and interactive environment. At the end, you will learn your score and have a change to log your initials in and compare to others who have taken the quiz!


### Impressions

I definitely have some issues with the end functionality to add in your initials for the score as well as to view them on the scoreboard. There were several renditions of this code that contained solutions to try to make this work and the one I ended up with still did not function as I would have liked. 

While I did not get the functionality working now, I would love to revisit this assignment and finish this game. It would be a great tool to utilize in a variety of ways and I would love to explore it more when I gain more knowledge on how to work with Javascript more efficiently.
